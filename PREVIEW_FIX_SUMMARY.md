## Common Preview Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Maps not loading"
**Solution:** Add GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY to .env file

### Issue: "Weather widget shows error"
**Solution:** Add OPENWEATHER_API_KEY to .env file

### Issue: "Can't sign in"
**Solution:** 
- Use demo credentials: `admin@asphalt-os.com` / `admin123`
- Check if database is properly seeded

### Issue: "Page loads slowly"
**Solution:** 
- First load is slower (cold start)
- Subsequent loads are much faster (cached)
- This is normal for preview environments

### Issue: "Images not showing"
**Solution:**
- Check S3 configuration (should be auto-configured)
- Try uploading a new image
- Check browser console for errors

---

## Performance Notes

### Expected Load Times (Preview):
- **Initial load:** 2-3 seconds (cold start)
- **Subsequent loads:** 0.5-1 second (cached)
- **Page navigation:** 100-300ms
- **API calls:** 50-200ms
- **Map loading:** 1-2 seconds (after API key added)
