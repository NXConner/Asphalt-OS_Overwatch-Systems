Creating comprehensive implementation files...
This will include:
- API routes for clock-in-out, app-settings, mock-data
- Division theme system
- Clock in/out components
- Enhanced UI components
- Hover cards
- Back buttons

Due to the massive scope (100+ file changes), I'll execute this in strategic phases.
Starting implementation now...
